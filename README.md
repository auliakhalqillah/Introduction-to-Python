## Introduction
I create this repository to share about fundamental of Python programming language based on my experience. Python has been introduced by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) in 1991. Currently, Python is a one of common programming languages that widely used in this century because the language is close to human language and easy to be learned. This programming language can be applied in some fields, such as:

- Web and Internet Davelopment
- Scientific Numeric
- Education
- Desktop GUIs
- Software Davelopment
- Bussiness Applications
- and much more

Python can be installed in Linux, Windows and Mac OS, for more information about the installation, you can visit the [Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

In this repository, I would like to explain:

1. How to setup Python online by using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) and Github Repository
2. Working with Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab
3. Working with fundamental Python libraries:
   - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
   - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
   - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
   - [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)

I hope this repository may help all of you to learn about Python programming language. Enjoy it :coffee:
